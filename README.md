# videoTracker
 
This function calculates the displacement of and between blobs drawn along 
the gauge length of a dog-bone sample subjected to uniaxial 
tension.
Initial input requires a calibration image with a scale bar. Following
that, blob displacemnt is calculated from a video of the blobs when the 
dog-bone sample was subjected to uniaxial tension.
