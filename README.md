# videoTracker
 
This function calculates the displacement of and between blobs drawn along the gauge length of a dog-bone sample subjected to uniaxial tension or compression.


- Initial input requires a calibration image with a scale bar. 
- Following that, blob displacemnt is calculated from a pre-saved video of the blobs when the dog-bone sample was subjected to uniaxial tension or compression.
